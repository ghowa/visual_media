* Using [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) on videos from aphasic people
* Using [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) with a custom-trained model on a new image corpus (pictures taken from social media)
* Visualising dominant colors in a picture (sample notebook [here](colours/ColourRun.ipynb))
* Using [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron)'s object recognition on book illustrations
