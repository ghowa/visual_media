This is a manual for our Workflow to train and use Detectron models for your own specific research questions on a Linux OS. 

## First step:
Install Detectron using this [walk through](https://github.com/passau-centre-for-ehumanities/visual_media/edit/master/howtos/install_detectron.md)

## Second step:
Install label me from [this repository](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme)

## Third step:
Presupposed, that you already constructed an Ontology (or other Schema) of the Symboles you want to train Detectron on, you can start now woth the anotation of the symbols in your training corpus. Our test showed, that it is neccesary to anotate at least 80 symboles to get good training results with Detectron.
