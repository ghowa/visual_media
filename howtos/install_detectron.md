# Detectron-Installation

**Before you consider installing Detectron, it is important to keep in mind, that you will need a powerfull Nividia Graficcard with at least 8 gb RAM (better 12) to make it work.**

This instructions are for an Installation of Detectron under Ubuntu 18.04. It should also work for any other Linux-distribution. Windows and Mac-systems, however, are not supported.

## First step:
Install Cuda and CuDNN.
For a proper installation of Cuda (I installed Cuda 10.0), go tu the [Nvidia Website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive) and follow the instructions.
